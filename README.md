# SMART-CALCULATOR-USING-HAND-GESTURES-AND-VISION-BASED-AI-

🧠✨ Smart Calculator Using Hand Gestures & Vision-Based AI (Streamlit UI)

This project is an AI-powered Smart Calculator that uses hand gesture recognition and computer vision, combined with a clean Streamlit front-end, to perform calculations through intuitive hand movements. No touch, no buttons — just gestures and intelligent vision-based processing.

🔍 Key Features

🤖 AI-driven hand gesture recognition

✋ Touchless calculator using real-time webcam input

🎨 Streamlit front-end UI for smooth and interactive experience

📐 Supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication & division

📊 Uses OpenCV + MediaPipe / Deep Learning models for gesture detection

📺 Live video stream embedded inside Streamlit

💡 Modular and beginner-friendly code

🧱 Tech Stack

Front-end: Streamlit

Backend / AI: Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe / TensorFlow / PyTorch

Utilities: NumPy

🚀 How It Works

Streamlit loads a live camera feed

Vision module detects hand landmarks in real time

Gesture classifier identifies the user’s gesture

Gesture is mapped to a calculator operation

Result is displayed instantly in Streamlit

📌 Use Cases

Touchless AI interfaces

Human–computer interaction demos

Student AI/ML projects

Assistive tech prototypes
